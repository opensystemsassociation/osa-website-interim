<p>On the evening of the summer solstice, members of the Open System Association will move the familiar framework of the kitchen into the experimental project space of <a href="http://hartslanestudios.org/2013/06/13/harts-lane-studios-hosts-everything-but-the-kitchen-june-21-23/">Harts Lane Studios</a>: an 11 hour material enquiry into how time is produced through relations between physical processes and is restructured through cultural and political techniques.</p>

<p>Engineered, commodified and consumed, kitchen time becomes labour time sold as leisure. By probing the powers underlying domestic drudgery, sociable seasons and cruel technologies, could we make it something different?</p>

<p>Opening Event: Friday 21 June 2013 6-9PM<br/>
Open: Saturday 22 and Sunday 23 June 2013 2-6PM <br/><p/>
